The SystemVerilog code defines a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR) which is used to generate pseudo-random binary sequences. The LFSR is implemented using a primitive polynomial of the form 1 + X^3 + X^4. In the context of an LFSR, a primitive polynomial is one that results in the LFSR cycling through the longest possible sequence of states (excluding the all-zero state) before repeating, which is `2^n - 1` (non-zero) states for an n-bit register.

Note: A primitive polynomial must be irreducible and it must have the order of `2^n - 1`.
